# ELT-Pipeline-GCP-Employee-data


## Overview

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable solution for processing and analyzing employee data. The pipeline automates data extraction, transformation, and loading, providing insights into employee performance, demographics, and other relevant metrics.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

1.  **Python Data Extraction:**
    * Python scripts are used to extract employee data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, databases, APIs).
    * The extracted data is then stored in Cloud Storage in a raw format.

2.  **Cloud Storage:**
    * Cloud Storage acts as a staging area for the raw employee data.
    * It provides a durable and scalable storage solution for the data before it is processed.

3.  **Cloud Data Fusion:**
    * Cloud Data Fusion is used for the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.
    * It orchestrates the data flow from Cloud Storage to BigQuery.
    * Data transformations, such as cleaning, filtering, and aggregation, are performed within Cloud Data Fusion.

4.  **BigQuery:**
    * BigQuery serves as the data warehouse for storing the transformed employee data.
    * It provides a serverless and scalable platform for querying and analyzing large datasets.
    * The data is organized into tables and schemas for efficient querying.

5.  **Looker:**
    * Looker is used for data visualization and reporting.
    * It connects to BigQuery and allows users to create interactive dashboards and reports.
    * Looker's LookML modeling layer provides a semantic layer for defining data relationships and metrics.
